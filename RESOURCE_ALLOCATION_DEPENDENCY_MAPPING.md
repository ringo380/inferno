   - **Mitigation**: API-first development with OpenAPI specifications
   - **Timeline Buffer**: 1 week

3. **Security Framework → Enterprise Features**
   - **Risk**: Enterprise deployment blocked without security
   - **Mitigation**: Basic security implementation in Phase 1, enhancement in Phase 2
   - **Timeline Buffer**: 3 weeks

#### Medium-Risk Dependencies
1. **Component Library → Advanced UI Features**
   - **Mitigation**: Incremental component development
