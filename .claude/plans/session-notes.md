  - `AppSettings` - Application settings with defaults
  - `Notification` - In-app notification system
  - `BatchJob` - Batch job management types
  - All types support Rust ↔ TypeScript serialization

#### 3. Command Handlers (51 commands)
- [x] Migrated all 51 commands from dashboard/src-tauri/src/main.rs
- [x] Organized commands into 10 categories:
  1. Core Model Operations (5 commands)
  2. Inference Operations (2 commands)
  3. System Information (4 commands)
  4. File Operations (2 commands)
  5. Settings Management (2 commands)
  6. Activity Logging (3 commands)
  7. Notifications (7 commands)
  8. Batch Jobs (9 commands)
  9. Security/API Keys (8 commands)
  10. Model Repository (10 commands)

#### 4. AppState Implementation
- [x] Full implementation in `state.rs` with:
  - Async initialization with `AppState::new()`
  - Settings persistence (JSON-based)
  - Event manager integration
  - Graceful shutdown with cleanup
  - Default implementation for fallback
- [x] Added `types` module export to `mod.rs`

### File Structure Created

```
src/interfaces/desktop/
├── mod.rs                    # ✅ Module exports + types
├── state.rs                  # ✅ Full AppState implementation
├── commands.rs               # ✅ All 51 command handlers
├── types.rs                  # ✅ NEW - Shared type definitions
├── backend_manager.rs        # ✅ Copied from dashboard
├── activity_logger.rs        # ✅ Copied from dashboard
├── security.rs               # ✅ Copied from dashboard
├── model_repository.rs       # ✅ Copied from dashboard
├── events.rs                 # ✅ Event emission system
└── macos.rs                  # ✅ macOS integration (Tauri v2)
```

**Total Lines of Code**: ~70,000+ lines in `src/interfaces/desktop/`

### Compilation Status

Expected compilation errors due to optional Tauri dependency:
- ✅ Structure is complete
- ✅ All imports properly organized
- ⚠️ Requires Tauri feature flag for full compilation
- ⚠️ Desktop interface will compile when used with dashboard
- ✅ Core library still compiles without Tauri

### Key Decisions

1. **No SQLite for v0.5.0**: Simplified to JSON-based settings persistence
2. **Event Manager**: Optional initialization allows library usage without Tauri
3. **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup of models and persistence on exit
4. **Type Safety**: All Rust types support serde serialization for frontend

### Configuration Files

**Root Cargo.toml Changes:**
```toml
version = "0.5.0"

[dependencies]
tauri = { version = "2.8", features = [...], optional = true }
tauri-plugin-* = { version = "2.0", optional = true }

[features]
desktop = [
    "tauri",
    "tauri-plugin-dialog",
    "tauri-plugin-fs",
    "tauri-plugin-shell",
    "tauri-plugin-notification",
    "tauri-plugin-os",
    "urlencoding",
    "rusqlite",
    "r2d2",
    "r2d2_sqlite",
    "gguf",
]
```

**Dashboard Cargo.toml Changes:**
```toml
name = "inferno-desktop"
version = "0.5.0"

[[bin]]
name = "inferno-desktop"
```

### Key Decisions

1. **Removed Tauri v1**: Incompatible with v2, causes kuchikiki version conflicts
2. **Feature-Gated Desktop**: Only compiles with `desktop` feature to avoid conflicts
3. **Universal Binaries**: Full ARM64 + x86_64 support for distribution
4. **Comprehensive Scripts**: Build automation with multiple modes and options

### Build Commands

**Desktop Development:**
```bash
cd dashboard && npm run tauri dev
```

**Desktop Release:**

## 💡 Key Insights

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Tauri v2 is Superior**
   - Dashboard implementation is production-ready
   - Has complete feature set (batch, security, database)
   - Uses modern plugin system
   - Only missing macOS polish

2. **Desktop as Primary Interface**
   - macOS desktop app will be the primary interface for v0.5.0
   - CLI becomes secondary for automation/scripting
   - TUI becomes optional for terminal users
   - API remains for programmatic access

3. **Modular Organization Works**
   - New `src/interfaces/desktop/` structure is clean
   - Separates concerns (commands, state, events, macOS)
   - Easy to maintain and extend
   - Ready for Phase 2 (Metal) additions

### Technical Challenges Identified

1. **State Management Complexity**
   - Dashboard AppState has 12 Arc<Mutex<T>> fields
   - Need to ensure thread-safety during migration
   - May need to refactor for better ergonomics

2. **Tauri v2 API Changes**
   - Menu API completely different from v1
   - Tray API uses new builder pattern
   - Plugin system requires explicit initialization
   - Need to update all v1 code patterns

3. **Database Dependency**
   - Dashboard uses SQLite for persistence
   - 32,000 lines in database.rs alone
   - Need to decide: keep SQLite or use simpler storage?

## 🚨 Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| SQLite overhead | Medium | Consider optional for v0.5.0, use JSON for now |
| State complexity | Medium | Refactor to use fewer Mutex wrappers |
| Menu API learning curve | Low | Follow Tauri v2 examples closely |
| Build time increase | Low | Optimize features, use incremental builds |
