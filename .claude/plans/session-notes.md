**Date**: 2025-09-29
**Session**: Initial Setup
**Duration**: ~1 hour

---

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. Planning & Documentation
- [x] Created comprehensive v0.5.0 plan document (`.claude/plans/2025-09-29_macos-desktop-refactor.md`)
- [x] Completed Tauri v1 vs v2 audit (`.claude/plans/tauri-migration-audit.md`)
- [x] Documented 51 Tauri v2 commands vs 14 Tauri v1 commands
- [x] Identified critical gaps and migration path

**Key Findings**:
- Tauri v2 (dashboard) is **significantly more complete** than v1
- 42 commands exist only in v2 (batch jobs, security, notifications, model repository)
- Only 5 macOS-specific commands need migration from v1 to v2
- Dashboard codebase has ~80,000+ lines of well-structured code

### 2. Desktop Interface Structure
- [x] Created `src/interfaces/desktop/` directory
- [x] Created `src/interfaces/desktop/mod.rs` - module exports
- [x] Created `src/interfaces/desktop/state.rs` - AppState skeleton
- [x] Created `src/interfaces/desktop/commands.rs` - command stubs
- [x] Created `src/interfaces/desktop/events.rs` - event system
- [x] Created `src/interfaces/desktop/macos.rs` - macOS integration (500+ lines)
- [x] Updated `src/interfaces/mod.rs` to include desktop module

**File Structure**:
```
src/interfaces/desktop/
â”œâ”€â”€ mod.rs           # âœ… Created - Module exports
â”œâ”€â”€ state.rs         # âœ… Created - AppState skeleton
â”œâ”€â”€ commands.rs      # âœ… Created - Command stubs
â”œâ”€â”€ events.rs        # âœ… Created - Event system
â””â”€â”€ macos.rs         # âœ… Created - macOS integration (Tauri v2 API)
```

### 3. macOS Integration Planning
- [x] Designed Tauri v2 menu bar system
- [x] Designed Tauri v2 system tray with live metrics
- [x] Implemented notification command stub
- [x] Implemented appearance detection stub
- [x] Implemented window vibrancy stub
- [x] Implemented always-on-top toggle
- [x] Implemented minimize-to-tray functionality
- [x] Added Metal GPU detection stub (Phase 2)
- [x] Added Apple Silicon chip detection stub (Phase 2)

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps (Immediate)

### Phase 1.3: Command Migration (Next Session)

**Priority 1: Core Infrastructure**
1. Copy `dashboard/src-tauri/src/backend_manager.rs` functionality
2. Copy `dashboard/src-tauri/src/database.rs` functionality
3. Copy `dashboard/src-tauri/src/security.rs` functionality
4. Copy `dashboard/src-tauri/src/events.rs` functionality
5. Integrate with new `src/interfaces/desktop/` structure

**Priority 2: Command Handlers**
1. Migrate all 51 commands from `dashboard/src-tauri/src/main.rs`
2. Organize into logical groups in `commands.rs`
3. Update to use unified AppState
4. Add proper error handling and logging

**Priority 3: macOS Integration**
1. Implement Tauri v2 menu bar API
2. Implement Tauri v2 system tray menu
3. Integrate `tauri-plugin-notification` for native notifications
4. Test window vibrancy effects
5. Test appearance detection

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Tauri v2 is Superior**
   - Dashboard implementation is production-ready
   - Has complete feature set (batch, security, database)
   - Uses modern plugin system
   - Only missing macOS polish

2. **Desktop as Primary Interface**
   - macOS desktop app will be the primary interface for v0.5.0
   - CLI becomes secondary for automation/scripting
   - TUI becomes optional for terminal users
   - API remains for programmatic access

3. **Modular Organization Works**
   - New `src/interfaces/desktop/` structure is clean
   - Separates concerns (commands, state, events, macOS)
   - Easy to maintain and extend
   - Ready for Phase 2 (Metal) additions

### Technical Challenges Identified

1. **State Management Complexity**
   - Dashboard AppState has 12 Arc<Mutex<T>> fields
   - Need to ensure thread-safety during migration
   - May need to refactor for better ergonomics

2. **Tauri v2 API Changes**
   - Menu API completely different from v1
   - Tray API uses new builder pattern
   - Plugin system requires explicit initialization
   - Need to update all v1 code patterns

3. **Database Dependency**
   - Dashboard uses SQLite for persistence
   - 32,000 lines in database.rs alone
   - Need to decide: keep SQLite or use simpler storage?

## ðŸš¨ Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| SQLite overhead | Medium | Consider optional for v0.5.0, use JSON for now |
| State complexity | Medium | Refactor to use fewer Mutex wrappers |
| Menu API learning curve | Low | Follow Tauri v2 examples closely |
| Build time increase | Low | Optimize features, use incremental builds |

---

## ðŸ“š Resources Created

1. **Main Plan**: `.claude/plans/2025-09-29_macos-desktop-refactor.md`
   - 6 phases with detailed task breakdowns
   - Success metrics and timelines
   - Technical references and dependencies

2. **Audit Document**: `.claude/plans/tauri-migration-audit.md`
   - Complete command comparison matrix
   - Architecture comparison
   - Migration strategy

3. **Session Notes**: `.claude/plans/session-notes.md` (this file)
   - Progress tracking
   - Insights and decisions
   - Next steps

4. **Code Structure**: `src/interfaces/desktop/`
   - 5 new files totaling ~800 lines
   - Production-ready structure
   - Ready for integration

---

## ðŸŽ“ Lessons Learned

1. **Audit First, Code Second**
   - Taking time to audit both implementations saved significant rework
   - Understanding the full feature set upfront was crucial
   - Documentation makes migration much clearer

2. **Dashboard is Gold**
   - The dashboard implementation is incredibly comprehensive
   - Better to migrate from dashboard than rewrite
   - Preserve all the hard work already done

3. **Structure Before Content**
   - Creating the skeleton structure first provides clear targets
   - Easier to fill in implementations step-by-step
   - Reduces cognitive load during migration

## ðŸ“Š Code Metrics

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **New Files Created** | 7 | All in `.claude/plans/` and `src/interfaces/desktop/` |
| **New Lines of Code** | ~1,200 | Mostly documentation and stubs |
| **Files to Migrate** | 6 | From `dashboard/src-tauri/src/` |
| **Commands to Migrate** | 51 | From dashboard main.rs |
| **Estimated Total LOC** | ~100,000+ | Including dashboard codebase |
