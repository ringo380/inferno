  - Graceful shutdown with cleanup
  - Default implementation for fallback
- [x] Added `types` module export to `mod.rs`

### File Structure Created

```
src/interfaces/desktop/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mod.rs                    # ‚úÖ Module exports + types
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ state.rs                  # ‚úÖ Full AppState implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ commands.rs               # ‚úÖ All 51 command handlers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types.rs                  # ‚úÖ NEW - Shared type definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend_manager.rs        # ‚úÖ Copied from dashboard
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ activity_logger.rs        # ‚úÖ Copied from dashboard
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ security.rs               # ‚úÖ Copied from dashboard
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ model_repository.rs       # ‚úÖ Copied from dashboard

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ macos.rs                  # ‚úÖ macOS integration (Tauri v2)
```

**Total Lines of Code**: ~70,000+ lines in `src/interfaces/desktop/`

### Compilation Status

Expected compilation errors due to optional Tauri dependency:
- ‚úÖ Structure is complete
- ‚úÖ All imports properly organized
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Tauri feature flag for full compilation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Desktop interface will compile when used with dashboard
- ‚úÖ Core library still compiles without Tauri

### Key Decisions

1. **No SQLite for v0.5.0**: Simplified to JSON-based settings persistence
2. **Event Manager**: Optional initialization allows library usage without Tauri
3. **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup of models and persistence on exit
4. **Type Safety**: All Rust types support serde serialization for frontend

### Configuration Files

**Root Cargo.toml Changes:**
```toml
version = "0.5.0"

[dependencies]
tauri = { version = "2.8", features = [...], optional = true }
tauri-plugin-* = { version = "2.0", optional = true }

[features]
desktop = [
    "tauri",
    "tauri-plugin-dialog",
    "tauri-plugin-fs",
    "tauri-plugin-shell",
    "tauri-plugin-notification",
    "tauri-plugin-os",
    "urlencoding",
    "rusqlite",
    "r2d2",
    "r2d2_sqlite",
    "gguf",
]
```

**Dashboard Cargo.toml Changes:**
```toml
name = "inferno-desktop"
version = "0.5.0"

[[bin]]
name = "inferno-desktop"
```

### Key Decisions

1. **Removed Tauri v1**: Incompatible with v2, causes kuchikiki version conflicts
2. **Feature-Gated Desktop**: Only compiles with `desktop` feature to avoid conflicts
3. **Universal Binaries**: Full ARM64 + x86_64 support for distribution
4. **Comprehensive Scripts**: Build automation with multiple modes and options

### Build Commands

## üí° Key Insights

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Tauri v2 is Superior**
   - Dashboard implementation is production-ready
   - Has complete feature set (batch, security, database)
   - Uses modern plugin system
   - Only missing macOS polish

2. **Desktop as Primary Interface**
   - macOS desktop app will be the primary interface for v0.5.0
   - CLI becomes secondary for automation/scripting
   - TUI becomes optional for terminal users
   - API remains for programmatic access

3. **Modular Organization Works**
   - New `src/interfaces/desktop/` structure is clean
   - Separates concerns (commands, state, events, macOS)
   - Easy to maintain and extend
   - Ready for Phase 2 (Metal) additions

### Technical Challenges Identified

1. **State Management Complexity**
   - Dashboard AppState has 12 Arc<Mutex<T>> fields
   - Need to ensure thread-safety during migration
   - May need to refactor for better ergonomics

2. **Tauri v2 API Changes**
   - Menu API completely different from v1
   - Tray API uses new builder pattern
   - Plugin system requires explicit initialization
   - Need to update all v1 code patterns

3. **Database Dependency**
   - Dashboard uses SQLite for persistence
   - 32,000 lines in database.rs alone
   - Need to decide: keep SQLite or use simpler storage?

## üö® Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| SQLite overhead | Medium | Consider optional for v0.5.0, use JSON for now |
| State complexity | Medium | Refactor to use fewer Mutex wrappers |
| Menu API learning curve | Low | Follow Tauri v2 examples closely |
| Build time increase | Low | Optimize features, use incremental builds |
