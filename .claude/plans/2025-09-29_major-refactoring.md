# Inferno Major Refactoring Plan

**Created**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: Active
**Complexity**: Complex
**Estimated Duration**: 6 weeks

## Overview

Comprehensive refactoring of the Inferno codebase to address architectural issues, improve maintainability, and reduce complexity. The codebase has grown to 118 files with 250k+ lines, with significant organizational and structural issues that need systematic resolution.

## Current State Analysis

### Code Statistics
- Total files: 118 Rust files
- Total lines: ~250,636
- Average file size: 2,106 lines
- Large files (>2000 lines): 21 files
- Modules: 40+ top-level modules
- CLI commands: 46 separate modules
- Config structs: 538
- Clone calls: 854
- Unwrap calls: 157 (needs elimination)

### Critical Issues
1. **Module sprawl**: 40+ top-level modules with unclear boundaries
2. **Massive files**: 21 files exceed 2,000 lines
3. **Config complexity**: 538 Config structs with excessive nesting
4. **CLI duplication**: 46 command files with repetitive patterns
5. **Inconsistent error handling**: 157 unwrap() calls
6. **Limited test coverage**: Only 36 files have unit tests (30%)

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2) ✅ COMPLETED

### Module Reorganization
- [x] Design new directory structure
- [x] Create feature-based module groups
  - [x] `src/core/` - Backend, models, config, security

  - [x] `src/operations/` - Deployment, backup, upgrade, resilience
  - [x] `src/ai_features/` - Conversion, multimodal, optimization, streaming
  - [x] `src/enterprise/` - Multi-tenancy, federated, marketplace, data_pipeline
  - [x] `src/interfaces/` - CLI, API, TUI, dashboard
- [x] Created mod.rs files with re-exports for transition

## Risk Mitigation

### Strategies
1. **Incremental changes**: Make small, verifiable changes
2. **Test-driven**: Add tests before refactoring
3. **Branch strategy**: Use feature branches for each phase
4. **Continuous validation**: Run full test suite after each change
5. **Documentation**: Update docs alongside code changes

### Rollback Plan
- Keep git history clean with atomic commits
- Tag known-good states
- Maintain changelog of breaking changes
- Document migration paths for API changes

## Next Session Notes

### Starting Point
Begin with Phase 1, Module Reorganization:
1. Design and document new directory structure
2. Create new directories
3. Move files incrementally
4. Update imports and verify compilation

### Blockers
- None identified yet

### Questions
- Should we maintain backward compatibility for config files?
- Do we need to coordinate with other developers?
- Are there any external dependencies on current module structure?

## Session Log
