# GitHub Issues Creation Instructions for Inferno

## Summary
I have successfully created 3 GitHub Issues via the API and prepared a comprehensive plan for 77 additional issues. Due to a temporary connectivity issue with the GitHub API, I'm providing instructions for creating the remaining issues manually.

## Issues Successfully Created (via GitHub API)
1. **Issue #3**: Complete GGUF Backend Implementation with Full Inference Support
   - Priority: High, Story Points: 8
   - Labels: priority: high, type: feature, component: backend, backend: gguf

2. **Issue #4**: Implement Complete ONNX Backend with ort Integration
   - Priority: High, Story Points: 10
   - Labels: priority: high, type: feature, component: backend, backend: onnx

3. **Issue #5**: Implement Model Discovery and Management System
   - Priority: High, Story Points: 8
   - Labels: priority: high, type: feature, component: models, area: management

## Manual Issue Creation Required
The comprehensive plan document `github_issues_comprehensive_plan.md` contains 77 additional detailed issues organized by priority and category.

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Create GitHub Labels First
Before creating issues, ensure these labels exist in the repository:

**Priority Labels:**
- `priority: high` (color: #d73a4a)
- `priority: medium` (color: #fbca04)
- `priority: low` (color: #0075ca)

**Type Labels:**
- `type: feature` (color: #a2eeef)
- `type: enhancement` (color: #84b6eb)
- `type: bug` (color: #d73a4a)
- `type: documentation` (color: #0075ca)
- `type: testing` (color: #fbca04)

**Component Labels:**
- `component: backend` (color: #ededed)
- `component: api` (color: #ededed)
- `component: models` (color: #ededed)
- `component: cache` (color: #ededed)
- `component: gpu` (color: #ededed)
- `component: security` (color: #ededed)
- `component: monitoring` (color: #ededed)
- `component: distributed` (color: #ededed)

**Backend-Specific Labels:**
- `backend: gguf` (color: #ededed)
- `backend: onnx` (color: #ededed)
- `backend: safetensors` (color: #ededed)

**Area Labels:**
- `area: management` (color: #ededed)
- `area: compatibility` (color: #ededed)
- `area: performance` (color: #ededed)
- `area: enterprise` (color: #ededed)

### 2. Create Milestones
Organize issues into logical milestones:

1. **Core Backend Implementation** (Target: 4-6 weeks)
   - GGUF and ONNX backend completion
   - Model management system
   - Basic API functionality

2. **API and Integration** (Target: 6-8 weeks)
   - OpenAI API compatibility
   - WebSocket streaming
   - Authentication and security

3. **Performance and Optimization** (Target: 8-10 weeks)
   - Caching systems
   - GPU acceleration
   - Memory optimization

4. **Enterprise Features** (Target: 10-12 weeks)
   - Security framework
   - Monitoring and observability
   - Distributed deployment

5. **Production Readiness** (Target: 12-14 weeks)
   - CI/CD pipeline
   - Documentation
   - Quality assurance

### 3. High Priority Issues to Create First
From the comprehensive plan, create these critical issues immediately:

1. **Complete OpenAI API Compatibility Implementation** (Issue #21)
2. **Implement Multi-Level Model Caching System** (Issue #33)
3. **Add CUDA GPU Acceleration Support** (Issue #36)
4. **Implement Enterprise Security Framework** (Issue #43)
5. **Add Prometheus Metrics Integration** (Issue #48)
6. **Create Production-Ready Docker Images** (Issue #58)
7. **Implement Comprehensive CI/CD Pipeline** (Issue #61)
8. **Expand Integration Test Coverage** (Issue #66)

### 4. Issue Creation Template
Use this template structure for each issue:

```markdown
## User Story
As a [user type], I want [functionality] so that [benefit].

## Problem Description
[Detailed description of the current state and what needs to be implemented]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Specific requirement 1]
- [ ] [Specific requirement 2]
- [ ] [Additional requirements...]

## Technical Implementation Notes
- [Technical approach and considerations]
- [Integration points and dependencies]
- [Architecture and design notes]

## Related Files
- [List of files that will be created or modified]

## Dependencies
- [Any external dependencies or blockers]

## Priority
[High/Medium/Low] - [Justification]

## Story Points
[1-13 based on complexity]
```

### 5. Batch Creation Recommendation
Create issues in batches by category:

**Batch 1: Core Infrastructure (High Priority)**
- Issues #6-#20 from the comprehensive plan
- Focus on backend implementations and model management

**Batch 2: API and Integration (High Priority)**
- Issues #21-#32 from the comprehensive plan
- OpenAI compatibility and WebSocket support

**Batch 3: Performance (Medium Priority)**
- Issues #33-#42 from the comprehensive plan
- Caching, GPU acceleration, memory optimization

**Batch 4: Enterprise Features (Medium Priority)**
- Issues #43-#57 from the comprehensive plan
- Security, monitoring, distributed systems

**Batch 5: DevOps and Quality (Mixed Priority)**
- Issues #58-#80 from the comprehensive plan
- Deployment, testing, documentation

## GitHub CLI Alternative
If preferred, you can use GitHub CLI to create issues in batch:

```bash
# Example for creating a single issue
gh issue create \
  --title "Complete GGUF Backend Implementation with Full Inference Support" \
  --body-file issue_template.md \
  --label "priority: high,type: feature,component: backend,backend: gguf" \
  --assignee "@me"
```

## Project Board Setup
Consider creating a GitHub Project board with columns:
- **Backlog** - All new issues
- **Ready** - Issues ready for development
- **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- **Review** - Pending code review
- **Done** - Completed issues

This structure will provide excellent project management and development tracking for the Inferno AI/ML inference server project.
