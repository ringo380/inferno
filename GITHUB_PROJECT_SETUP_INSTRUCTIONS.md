# GitHub Project Board Setup Instructions

Since GitHub Projects v2 requires additional authentication scopes that need interactive setup, here are manual instructions for creating the project board to complete the GitHub organization.

## Creating the Project Board

1. **Navigate to Projects**
   - Go to https://github.com/ringo380/inferno
   - Click on the "Projects" tab
   - Click "New project"

2. **Project Configuration**
   - **Name**: "Inferno Development Board"
   - **Description**: "Comprehensive project management for Inferno AI inference platform development"
   - **Template**: Start with "Board" template

3. **Column Setup**
   Create these columns in order:

   - **Backlog**
     - Description: "All new issues and planned work items"
     - Automation: None initially

   - **Sprint Planning**
     - Description: "Issues being planned for upcoming sprint"
     - Automation: None initially

   - **Ready**
     - Description: "Issues ready to be worked on"
     - Automation: None initially

   - **In Progress**
     - Description: "Currently being worked on"
     - Automation: Auto-move when PR is opened

   - **In Review**
     - Description: "Under code review or testing"
     - Automation: Auto-move when PR is ready for review

   - **Done**
     - Description: "Completed work"
     - Automation: Auto-move when issues are closed

## Field Configuration

Add these custom fields to track additional metadata:

1. **Priority**
   - Type: Single select
   - Options: Critical, High, Medium, Low

2. **Size**
   - Type: Single select
   - Options: XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL

3. **Component**
   - Type: Single select
   - Options: Backend, API, CLI, TUI, Config, Models, Metrics, Cache, Batch, IO

4. **Area**
   - Type: Single select
   - Options: Infrastructure, Performance, Enterprise, DevOps, Security, Monitoring, Distributed

## Automation Rules

Set up these automation rules:

### Auto-assign to project
- **Trigger**: Issue created in repository
- **Action**: Add to project in "Backlog" column

### Move to In Progress
- **Trigger**: Issue assigned to someone
- **Action**: Move to "In Progress" column

### Move to In Review
- **Trigger**: Pull request opened that references issue
- **Action**: Move to "In Review" column

### Move to Done
- **Trigger**: Issue closed
- **Action**: Move to "Done" column

## Initial Issue Import

After setting up the project board:

1. **Bulk import existing issues**
   - Go to project settings
   - Use "Add items" to bulk import issues
   - Start with high-priority and recent issues

2. **Apply labels and fields**
   - Use the new label system created
   - Set appropriate priority, size, and component fields
   - Assign to appropriate milestones

## View Configuration

Create these saved views:

### Sprint Planning View
- **Filter**: Status = "Backlog" OR Status = "Sprint Planning"
- **Group by**: Priority
- **Sort by**: Priority (Critical first)

### Active Sprint View
- **Filter**: Status = "Ready" OR Status = "In Progress" OR Status = "In Review"
- **Group by**: Assignee
- **Sort by**: Priority

### Component Overview
- **Filter**: All items
- **Group by**: Component
- **Sort by**: Status

### Milestone Progress
- **Filter**: All items
- **Group by**: Milestone
- **Sort by**: Status

## Integration with Labels

The project board should integrate with the label system:

### Priority Mapping
- `priority/critical` → Priority field: Critical
- `priority/high` → Priority field: High
- `priority/medium` → Priority field: Medium
- `priority/low` → Priority field: Low

### Size Mapping
- `size/XS` → Size field: XS
- `size/S` → Size field: S
- `size/M` → Size field: M
- `size/L` → Size field: L
- `size/XL` → Size field: XL
- `size/XXL` → Size field: XXL

### Component Mapping
- `component/*` labels → Component field values
- `area/*` labels → Area field values

## Team Workflow

### Daily Workflow
1. Check "Active Sprint View" for current work
2. Update issue status as work progresses
3. Move items between columns as appropriate
4. Comment on issues with progress updates

### Sprint Planning
1. Use "Sprint Planning View" to review backlog
2. Assign issues to team members
3. Move selected issues to "Ready" column
4. Ensure proper priority and size labeling

### Weekly Reviews
1. Review "Milestone Progress" view
2. Identify blocked or stalled issues
3. Adjust priorities based on progress
4. Plan upcoming sprint capacity

## Command Line Integration

After manual setup, you can use GitHub CLI for project management:

```bash
# List project items
gh project item-list [PROJECT_NUMBER] --owner ringo380

# Add issue to project
gh project item-add [PROJECT_NUMBER] --owner ringo380 --url [ISSUE_URL]

# Update project item status
gh project item-edit --id [ITEM_ID] --field-id [FIELD_ID] --single-select-option-id [OPTION_ID]
```

## Maintenance Tasks

### Weekly
- Review and triage new issues in Backlog
- Update project item statuses
- Ensure proper labeling

### Bi-weekly
- Sprint planning and capacity review
- Milestone progress assessment
- Blocked issue resolution

### Monthly
- Project board configuration review
- Automation rule optimization
- Team workflow assessment

## Success Metrics

Track these metrics to measure project management effectiveness:

1. **Cycle Time**: Time from "Ready" to "Done"
2. **Lead Time**: Time from "Backlog" to "Done"
3. **Throughput**: Issues completed per sprint
4. **Work in Progress**: Items in "In Progress" column
5. **Blocked Items**: Issues stuck in status

## Next Steps

1. Follow these instructions to set up the project board manually
2. Import existing issues and apply proper labeling
3. Train team members on the new workflow
4. Set up automation rules for efficiency
5. Begin using the board for sprint planning

This completes the comprehensive GitHub project organization for the Inferno repository!
