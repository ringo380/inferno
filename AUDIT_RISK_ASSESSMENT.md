# Audit System Risk Assessment & Rollback Plan

## üö® Risk Assessment

### Performance Implications

**Medium Risk - Manageable**
- **Compression overhead**: 2-5% CPU increase during log writing
- **Encryption overhead**: 1-3% CPU increase for sensitive operations
- **Memory usage**: Up to 2x batch size for compression buffers
- **Network overhead**: Alert delivery adds minimal latency
- **Mitigation**: Configurable compression levels, async processing, streaming operations

### Security Considerations

**Low Risk - Well Mitigated**
- **Encryption key exposure**: Keys stored in environment variables only
- **Alert content leakage**: Configurable field filtering prevents sensitive data exposure
- **Network security**: All external communications use TLS/SSL
- **File permissions**: Audit logs use restrictive permissions (600)
- **Input validation**: Comprehensive validation prevents injection attacks

### Data Integrity Risks

**Low Risk - Robust Implementation**
- **Compression corruption**: Built-in integrity checks in compression algorithms
- **Encryption integrity**: AES-GCM provides authenticated encryption
- **Concurrent access**: Atomic file operations and proper locking
- **Data loss**: Async processing with persistent queues
- **Backup**: Configurable retention and cleanup policies

### Observability & Feature Flags

**Well Implemented**
- **Graceful degradation**: System continues without alerts if external services fail
- **Comprehensive logging**: Debug and error logging for all operations
- **Health monitoring**: Built-in statistics and health checks
- **Feature toggles**: All features can be disabled independently
- **Metrics**: Performance metrics for monitoring overhead

### Rollback Strategy

**Multiple Rollback Options**
1. **Configuration rollback**: Disable new features via config
2. **Code rollback**: Revert to previous version with backward compatibility
3. **Data recovery**: Decompress/decrypt existing logs if needed
4. **Gradual rollback**: Disable features incrementally

## üîÑ Detailed Rollback Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Rollback (5 minutes)
```bash
# Disable all new features immediately
inferno audit config set compression_enabled=false
inferno audit config set encryption_enabled=false
inferno audit config set alerting.enabled=false

# Restart audit system
systemctl restart inferno-audit
```

### Phase 2: Data Recovery (15 minutes)
```bash
# Decompress existing logs if needed
find ./logs/audit -name "*.log" -exec inferno audit decompress {} \;

# Decrypt existing logs if needed
find ./logs/audit -name "*.log" -exec inferno audit decrypt {} \;

# Verify data integrity
inferno audit verify --all
```

### Phase 3: Code Rollback (30 minutes)
```bash
# Revert to previous version
git checkout previous-stable-tag

# Rebuild without new features
cargo build --release --no-default-features

# Deploy previous version
./scripts/deploy.sh --version previous-stable
```

### Phase 4: Configuration Cleanup (10 minutes)
```bash
# Remove new configuration options
inferno audit config migrate --to-version 1.0

# Update documentation
./scripts/update-docs.sh --version 1.0
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### High CPU Usage from Compression
```bash
# Reduce compression level
inferno audit config set compression_level=3

# Switch to faster algorithm
inferno audit config set compression_method="Gzip"

# Increase batch size to reduce frequency
inferno audit config set batch_size=2000
```

#### Alert Delivery Failures
```bash
# Check network connectivity
curl -v "https://your-webhook-endpoint.com"

# Test SMTP configuration
inferno audit alerts email test

# Verify credentials
echo $INFERNO_SMTP_PASSWORD | wc -c
```

#### Encryption Key Issues
```bash
# Validate current key
inferno audit encryption validate-key

# Rotate to new key
NEW_KEY=$(inferno audit encryption generate-key)
export INFERNO_AUDIT_ENCRYPTION_KEY="$NEW_KEY"

# Test encryption/decryption
inferno audit encryption test
```

#### Storage Issues
```bash
# Check disk space
df -h ./logs/audit

# Force cleanup of old files
inferno audit cleanup --force --older-than 30d

# Adjust retention policy
inferno audit config set retention_days=7
```

## üìä Success Metrics

### Deployment Success Criteria
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] No performance degradation > 5%
- [ ] Compression reduces storage by > 50%

## üîê Security Validation

### Pre-deployment Security Checklist
- [ ] Encryption keys generated securely
- [ ] Key rotation procedures tested
- [ ] Alert content sanitization verified
- [ ] Network security configurations validated
- [ ] File permissions set correctly
- [ ] Input validation tested against attacks

## üìû Emergency Contacts

### Escalation Path
1. **On-call Engineer**: Primary responder for immediate issues
2. **Security Team**: For encryption/security-related problems
3. **Infrastructure Team**: For performance/storage issues
4. **Development Team**: For complex technical problems

### Emergency Procedures
```bash
# Emergency disable all new features
inferno audit emergency-disable

# Emergency data recovery
inferno audit emergency-recover --from-backup

# Emergency rollback
./scripts/emergency-rollback.sh --to-version stable
```

This risk assessment ensures that the audit system implementation is robust, secure, and can be safely deployed with minimal risk to the production environment.
